# ANIMO
EPS Project Team 5 ISEP

For the EPS project in 2023 in Porto, Team 5 has developed an innovative idea called ANIMO. ANIMO is a company specializing in the creation of surveillance blimps used for monitoring vast cattle populations in Australia. To enhance the control and utilization of these blimps, we have developed a dedicated app. This app empowers users to access a comprehensive overview of all the blimps, enabling them to monitor and control their movements and perform other related actions.

Within this directory, you will find the code for the frontend, backend, and database components that were instrumental in bringing this app to life. The frontend code handles the user interface, ensuring a seamless and intuitive experience. The backend code enables the app to communicate with the blimps and process user commands. The database code ensures efficient storage and retrieval of pertinent information to support the app's functionalities.
